# Log Aggregation Service

## Introduction

This project is a robust log aggregation service that offers gRPC endpoints for producing and consuming logs. It supports streaming capabilities, ensuring real-time log processing. The log store is replicated using the Raft consensus algorithm with a leader-follow pattern, enhancing fault tolerance and reliability. Additionally, the service ensures secure communication using TLS, with authorization also handled via TLS. Deployment is streamlined and simplified using Helm charts.
